## 🧠 Research Understanding & Perspective  

This paper investigates how AI-generated images influence creativity during ideation. The study finds that generative AI increases **design fixation**, resulting in fewer, less varied, and less original ideas. It also introduces **fixation displacement**, where designers shift attention from initial examples to AI outputs.

The work builds upon Jansson & Smith’s classic design fixation experiments, extending the paradigm into modern GenAI contexts. By comparing **no support**, **Google Image Search**, and **Midjourney**, and quantifying outcomes using divergent-thinking metrics, the study provides updated empirical evidence within an HCI framework.

Subsequent research reflects its influence. Pu et al. (2025) emphasize structured idea evolution to mitigate fixation risks, while Wu et al. (2025) highlight broader concerns regarding originality, dependence, and cognitive implications of AIGC.

## 🤖 Reflection on AI Use  

### ⚠️ Challenges & Limitations  

- **Information Reliability**  
  Occasional inaccuracies required manual verification  

- **Information Overload**  
  Excessively detailed outputs complicated insight extraction  

- **Tool Evaluation Complexity**  
  Cross-tool comparison lacked consistent criteria  

- **Platform Constraints**  
  Usage caps necessitated workflow adjustments  

- **Cost vs. Quality Trade-offs**  
  High credit consumption did not always yield satisfactory results  

- **Prompt & Creative Constraints**  
  Iterative refinement was frequently necessary  

**Mitigation Approaches**  
✔ Structured prompting  
✔ Systematic verification  
✔ Predefined evaluation criteria  
✔ Pilot testing  
✔ Proactive workflow planning
